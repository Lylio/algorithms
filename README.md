**System Design Algorithms**

I anticipate this repo to be fairly dynamic in which it grows when I find and add cool new algorithm stuff as and when I find it. The following algos 
are taken from [ByteByteGo](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/algorithms-you-should-know-before?triedSigningIn=true) and focus on
cool **system design** concepts:
- Geohash
- Quadtree
- Consistent Hashing
- Leaky Bucket
- Token Bucket
- Trie
- Rsync
- Raft/Paxos
- Bloomfilter
- Merkle Tree
- HyperLogLog
- Count-min Sketch
- Hierarchical Timing Wheels
- Operational Transform
